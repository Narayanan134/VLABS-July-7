#### **Step by Step Procedure to perform experiment**

##### **A)BFSK Modulation**

 **Step1:** The user should click on the theory under which the concept behind the working of the experiment would be displayed followed by the procedure which would be displayed in the screen, so that the user could perform the BFSK modulation and demodulation experiment based on the guidelines listed under the procedure.

  **Step2**:The blocks required for the experiment is displayed. The user should connect the blocks as per the block diagram in the theory.

 **Step3:** Once the user performs Step 2, then the user could very well double click on the binary data sequence block, so that the user could set the digital bits, frequency, horizontal and vertical scales to get the required graph.

**Step4:** Once the user performs Step 3, then the user can double click on the modulated BFSK output block to view the modulated BFSK graph.

 **Step5:**  Once the user performs Step 4, then the user has successfully performed the BFSK Modulation and the below figure depicts the workspace to perform the experiment of BFSK Modulation.

##### Sample wiring layout for connecting the various blocks:

To remove a particular wire or undo a wire, select the wire first, the wire gets highlighted and now click on delete button.

The reset button is available at the top right corner of the simulation, so that it clears all the existing connections.

#### Quiz

Quiz dialog box appears once we finish our connections for both modulation and demodulation.

##### **B)BFSK Demodulation**

 **Step1:** Once the user performs the BFSK Modulation, then the user would be redirected below where the user would see the BFSK Demodulation /Receiver.



**Step2:** Once the user performs Step 1, then the user could then see the demodulation part of BFSK experiment to carry out the demodulation by connecting the required blocks.

 **Step3:** Once the user performs Step 2, then the user could simulate the BFSK demodulation i.e. click on the demodulated BFSK output. Once the Compilation of the design model is completed then the output process i.e., the extraction of the modulated signal from the modulating signal. Would be performed and the output which is the modulated signal (message signal).

  **Step4:** Once the user performs Step 3, then the user has successfully performed the BFSK Demodulation. Figure-16 depicts the workspace to perform the experiment of BFSK Demodulation.
