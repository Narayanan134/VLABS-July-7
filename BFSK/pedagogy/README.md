#### **About the experiment:**
Binary FSK is the most common form of FSK. With binary FSK, the center or carrier frequency is shifted by the binary input signal. Consequently, the output from an FSK modulator is a step function in the frequency domain. As the binary input signal changes from a logic 0 to logic 1 and vice versa, the FSK output signal shifts between two frequencies; a mark or logic 1 frequency and a space or logic 0 frequency. Users can see the binary input and the varying output frequency through the GUI. It is a constant-envelope form of angle modulation similar to conventional frequency modulation except that the modulating signal varies between two discrete voltage levels (i.e., 1’s and 0’s) rather than with a continuously changing value, such as a sine wave.
