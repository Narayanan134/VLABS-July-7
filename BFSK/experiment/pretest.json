      "question": "BFSK has a ______ bandwidth than BPSK.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lower",
        "b": "Higher",
        "c": "Same"
      },
      "explanation":"The Bandwidth for PSK is fb and for FSK is 2(∆f+f_b). Hence the bandwidth of FSK is higher than PSK.",
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },

      "question": "FSK reception is deployed using",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Correlation receiver & Phase Locked Loop",
        "b": "Phase Locked Loop",
        "c": "Correlation receiver",

      "question": "Mark and space are represented in BFSK using",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0",
        "b": "1 and 0",
        "c": "1"
      },
      "explanation":"In BFSK, mark represents 1 and space represents 0",

      "question": "The data pattern used for generation of FSK will be",
      "answers": {
        "a": "NRZ",
        "b": "RZ",
        "c": "Split phase"
      },
      "explanation":"In BFSK, the input bits are coded by a line coding format where mark values are represented by positive voltage and space values are represented by negative voltage called Non Return to Zero(NRZ) pattern.",

        "a": "200 to 500Hz",
        "b": "50 to 1000Hz",
        "c": "500 to 10KHz",
        "d": "100 to 2000Hz"
      },
      "explanation":"Frequency deviation, ∆f=|f_m-f_s |/2 ; where f_m=49kHz and f_s=51kHz therefore ∆f=1kHz.Minimum bandwidth, B=2(∆f+f_b); where fb=2kbps, therefore B=2(1k+2k)=6kHz.",
