**About the experiment:**

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is a form of Phase Shift Keying in which two bits are modulated at once, selecting one of four possible carrier phase shifts (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees). QPSK allows the signal to carry twice as much information as ordinary PSK using the same bandwidth. The Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK is a variation of BPSK, and it is also a Double Side Band Suppressed Carrier DSBSC modulation scheme, which sends two bits of digital information at a time, called as dibits .Instead of the conversion of digital bits into a series of digital stream, it converts them into bit pairs. This decreases the data bit rate to half, which allows space for the other users.**
