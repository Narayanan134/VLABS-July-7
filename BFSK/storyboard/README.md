#### Proposal ID : **NITK_PALS_22_017_01**

#### Experiment Name : **Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK)**


#### **Story Outline:**
Experiment focuses on understanding the principle of Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK). This experiment is formulated to show the modulation and demodulation of the same technique through different digital inputs and frequencies. Further, the modulated signal can be viewed in time and frequency domain and bit error rate can be estimated

#### **Story:**

 The simulator workspace includes blocks such as binary data sequence for providing the binary data as the input, on-off level encoder for level shifting. Here the binary 1 is level shifted to   and binary 0 is maintained at same level. The inverter is used to make sure that frequency f1 is transmitted when symbol 1 is given as input. When symbol 0 is transmitted upper channel is turned OFF and lower channel is turned ON. The multiplier multiplies the corresponding signal and given to adder to get modulated signal. The demodulator section consists of multiplier, integrator and decision device where the received BFSK modulated signal is demodulated to get the estimated Binary output. Estimation of Bit error rate calculation is done based on the extracted parameter.

## **Storyboard:**


### ***Transmiter side:***
**Binary Data Sequence:**
This is the input blocks of the transmitter component, where bit sequence is solemnly used for message signal generation dedicated for carrier wave generation as depicted below.

![Blocks](./storyboard/bid.gif)

**ON OFF Level Encoder:**
ON-OFF Keying (OOK) is most commonlyÂ used to transmit Morse code over radio frequenciesÂ (referred to as continuous wave operation), although in principle any digital encoding scheme may be used. OOK has been used in the ISM bands to transfer data between computers.

**Product Modulator:**
The modulated output is substantially equal to the carrier and the modulating wave; the term implies a device in which intermodulation between components of the modulating wave does not occur. This block is as depicted below. 

![Blocks](./storyboard/pm.gif)

**Adder :**
 Adder is used to add the signals from both the product modulators. 

![Blocks](./storyboard/add.gif)

**Inverter :**
A digital inverter is a basic building block of many binary devices. It simply takes a zero or one as input and returns a one or zero, respectively, as output. 

![Blocks](./storyboard/inv.gif)

**Modulated BFSK Output :**
 The modulated BFSK output block gives us the modulated output of the BFSK signal. The output block is as depicted below.

### ***Receiver side:***

**Received Modulated BFSK Signal :**
 Received modulated BFSK signal is a device for reception of radio frequency (RF). A receiving antenna performs the reverse of the process performed by the transmission antenna. It receives radiofrequency radiation or in this case the transmitted signal .This process is depicted below. 

![Blocks](./storyboard/r1.gif)

**Integrator :**
An integrator in measurement and control applications isÂ an element whose output signal is the time integral of its input signal. It accumulates the input quantity over a defined time to produce a representative output

![Blocks](./storyboard/int.gif)

**Decision device :**
 The timing circuit determines the sampling times. The decision device is enabled at these sampling times. The decision deviceÂ decides its output based on whether the amplitude of the quantized pulseÂ and the noise, exceeds a pre-determined value or not.

**Demodulated BFSK Output :**
The demodulated BFSK output block gives us the demodulated output of the BFSK signal. The output block is as depicted below.
